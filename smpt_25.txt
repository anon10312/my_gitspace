_SimpleMailTransferProtocol_

textual protocol used to send messages from a client to a mail server over TCP. (Today standard is extended smtp).
default port: 25 [587 (used by some clients) and 485 (deprecated)]
SMTPS: SMTP + TLS

client specify one or more receiver -> check if receiver exist -> transmission to server

command exchange:
	- MAIL FROM:
	- RCPT TO: [one per receiver]
	- DATA

weakness: SMPT doesn't implement authentication -> can send mail as another user -> solution : SMTP_AUTH
